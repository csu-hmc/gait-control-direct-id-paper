This repository holds analyses for control identification in human gait being
performed at the Human Motion and Control Laboratory at Cleveland State
University. It is our aim to share the protocols, data, and analyses in a
computationally reproducible manner. This repository relies heavily on our
`Gait Analsys Toolkit <https://github.com/csu-hmc/Gait-Analysis-Toolkit/>`_ for
computation. The files here change rapidly and as the analyses and data
management techniques are refined then functionality is pushed into the Gait
Analysis Toolkit.

The notebooks can be viewed here:
